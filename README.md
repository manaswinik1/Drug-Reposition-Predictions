Drug Repurposing Predictions

Project Description:
This project is dedicated to leveraging computational methods for predicting drug repurposing opportunities. Utilizing Python and various data analysis and machine learning libraries, it delves into pharmaceutical data to identify potential new uses for existing drugs. The project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. The primary goal is to harness the power of data and machine learning to find new therapeutic applications for known drugs, potentially speeding up the drug development process and reducing costs.
